## Current known issues:

```python
# Collider on moving puzzle parts.
   The colliders are sometimes too big and block the players movement in an annoying manner.

# Ranged enemy
   The enemy can get stuck shooting in a wrong direction.
   The enemy's projectiles don't work as inteded.

# Melee enemy
   Does not always damage the player.

# Puzzles
   The puzzles can be softlocked sometimes.

# Dash
   Dash stops if the player pauses during dash. (Known issue, probably won't have time to figure it out)

# Audio Settings
   The values for the slider valuedisplays don't update correctly at the start of the game.
